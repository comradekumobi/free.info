<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>free.info v2</h1><br/><p>free.info v.2</p><p>Hi!</p><p>	The purpose of this doc is to provide a simplistic and safe catalogue of pirating sites. Pirating can often seem dangerous and complicated to people who have never done it before, so I made this guide to show that it&#39;s completely safe and accessible! This doc covers all types of media such as film, tv, games, music, books, academic resources, and even getting unlimited full versions of software such as the adobe suite completely for free. </p><p>	</p><p>	Since these resources can be used to save A LOT of money (I have some fun statistics about that at the bottom of the doc) I highly encourage you to find independent artists whose art you enjoy and throw some money their way. </p><p>	</p><p>	If you have any suggestions or questions please let me know! I&#39;d love to expand the doc to meet more needs, so if there is some paid software you want and you don&#39;t see it on here, I can look around for you! Also, feel free to share this doc around! The more people cancelling their Netflix or Adobe subscriptions the better. :) </p><p></p><p>Beside each link are some tags. Tags for links in this doc include:</p><p>- Streaming: This is the simplest and safest to use. This website will stream the media you&#39;re looking for to your browser. For example, you can search for a move you want to watch on movie-web.app and it will stream it directly to you, no download required :)</p><p></p><p>- Download required: This means it requires a download to function. For example, a pdf if you&#39;re trying to get a book.</p><p></p><p>- Setup Required: This needs to be downloaded and setup separately. GenP, a program that unlocks the adobe suite for free, requires a few steps to setup, so this may take some technical knowledge. Guides for how to install these are in included in the link to it.</p><p></p><p>- Sideloading Required: This means it is an app that you cannot get on the native app stores to your mobile device. You&#39;ll need to use your pc to install a third-party app store to get the app on your mobile device. A guide for how to do this on IOS and Android is included below.</p><p></p><p>- My favorites: Self examplanitory. Just my favorite links to use.</p><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">BEFORE USING ANY OF THESE LINKS!!</span></strong></p><p>Make sure to install <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock</a>. The installation is simple, follow the link attached and scroll to the bottom and find your internet browser of choice. Follow the instructions to install uBlock as a plugin to your browser and you&#39;re all set! uBlock is a very important tool because it blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, annoying anti-blockers, and malware sites.</p><p></p><p>The final frontier of capitalism is your attention. So here are some tools that make sure all that advertising money goes to waste and all the content they&#39;ve locked behind paywalls is free and available.</p><p></p><p>happy pirating!</p><p>	-ana :3</p><p></p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><p></p><p>*Note on how this is organized: some links will show up in two sections, for example: spotC++ shows up in “music” and “ios software” since both categories apply to it</p><p></p><p>- Movie/TV/Anime</p><p>- Video Games</p><p>   → Emulators</p><p>   → Roms</p><p>   → Modern Games</p><p>- Music</p><p>- Books</p><p>   → Books/Academic resources</p><p>   → Comics/Manga</p><p>- Free Software/Paywall Work-arounds</p><p>   → Websites</p><p>   → PC &amp; Mac software</p><p>- Mobile Apps and Work-arounds</p><p>   → IOS &amp; Android Sideloading Guide</p><p>   → IOS software</p><p>   → Android software</p><p>- Alternatives to Google Services</p><p>- Some funny statistics</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Movies/TV/Anime</strong></p><p>- <a href="https://movie-web.app/search/movie">Movie-Web</a></p><p>   → Stream almost any movie/tv show for free, with subtitles</p><p>   → if a video&#39;s audio is in a different language, go to the gear icon &gt; source&gt; and select a different provider and this should fix it</p><p>- <a href="https://ww2.123moviesfree.net/">123Movies</a></p><p>   → more movie/tv streaming </p><p>- <a href="https://www1.kisscartoon.online/">KissCartoon</a></p><p>   → Streaming for cartoons</p><p>- <a href="https://ww4.gogoanime2.org/">GoAnime</a></p><p>   → Anime Streaming</p><p></p><p><strong>Video Games</strong></p><p></p><p>Emulators</p><p></p><p>Nintendo consoles</p><p>- <a href="https://mgba.io/">Gameboy/Advance</a></p><p>- <a href="https://fceux.com/web/home.html">NES</a></p><p>- <a href="https://www.snes9x.com/">SNES</a></p><p>- <a href="https://www.pj64-emu.com/">N64</a></p><p>- <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Wii/Gamecube</a></p><p>- <a href="https://citra-emu.org/">3DS/DS</a></p><p>- <a href="https://cemu.info/">Wii U</a> </p><p>- <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/">Switch</a></p><p></p><p>Playstation</p><p>- <a href="https://www.duckstation.org/">Playstation</a></p><p>   → Bios</p><p>- <a href="https://pcsx2.net/">Playstation 2</a></p><p>   → Bios</p><p>- <a href="https://rpcs3.net/">Playstation 3</a></p><p>- <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/">PSP</a></p><p>- <a href="https://vita3k.org/">PS Vita</a></p><p></p><p>Xbox</p><p>- <a href="https://xemu.app/">Xbox</a></p><p>- <a href="https://xenia.jp/">Xbox 360</a></p><p></p><p>Link to alternate emulators for each platform and some I haven&#39;t included:</p><p><a href="https://vimm.net/emulate">Vimm&#39;s Lair Emulators</a></p><p></p><p>Roms</p><p></p><p>- <a href="https://vimm.net/vault">Vimm&#39;s Lair</a></p><p>   → Great resource for roms from all sorts of consoles</p><p></p><p>Modern Games</p><p></p><p>- <a href="https://rentry.org/pgames#required-components">Games Piracy Megathread</a> CAREFUL</p><p>   → This is a really helpful guide if you want to pirate more modern games on PC.

Many websites accept google accounts instead of creating an account through the website, and many companies and schools either suggest or require use of google services. While its often difficult to circumvent the use of google products in the latter case, I want to show how it is possible to use the internet without google collecting your data while remaining just as convenient.</p><p></p><p>Also I&#39;m a petty bitch and google deleted the last version of this doc. So here&#39;s a whole section dedicated to alternative programs to all of the services google offers. :3</p><p></p><p>- Email</p><p>   → Protonmail</p></div>
